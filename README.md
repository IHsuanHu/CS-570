## Introduction to Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This is a course on standard data structures, including sorting and searching and using the Java language. The topics include: programming; testing; recursion; elementary data structures (lists, stacks, queues, and maps); use of elementary data structures in application rameworks; searching; sorting; and introduction to asymptotic complexity analysis.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES
After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Abstract Data Types: Understand the notion of Abstract Data Types, and their use in object-oriented designs.
- Complexity - Calculate the Big O of diverse non-recursive algorithms and use it to compare efficiency.
- Collections - Use and understand Collection class in Java, with major emphasis on Lists, Stacks and Queues. Implement double linked lists in Java.
- Trees - Implement Binary Search Trees, Max/Min-Heaps, Priority Queues in Java, and understand the basic concepts of self-balancing Binary Search Trees
- Sets-Maps - Understand what are Sets and Maps, and more specifically implement hash tables in Java.
- Recursion- Understand, and implement recursive algorithms, and data structures.
- Programming - Combine different classes together to implement big programming assignments in Java that combines some of the data structures studied in class.
